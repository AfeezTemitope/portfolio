            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>As a self-taught designer turned software engineer, I am passionate about the intersection of creativity and technology. My journey began with exploring design tools like Corel Draw and Photoshop, which sparked my interest in tech and led me to pursue software engineering immediately after graduating from LASU, where I studied Project Management Technology.
                Over the past year at Semicolon Africa, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of both frontend and backend development. I have honed my skills in programming languages such as JavaScript, Java, Python, and C++, as well as frameworks like Spring Boot, Django, Flask, and React. My commitment to continuous learning drives me to stay updated with industry trends and best practices.
                With my unique blend of design skills and technical expertise, I approach problems from a creative perspective. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with talented teams, leveraging my skills to build impactful solutions and support the growth of the tech industry.
            </h3>
